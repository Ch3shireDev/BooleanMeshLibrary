# BooleanMeshLibrary
My abandoned project on boolean operations on meshes. Code is a mess, performance is even worse. Use at own risk.

Great thanks to Jukka Jylänki, the author of MathGeoLib. I wouldn't be able to create this library if not the simplicity of his code.

Code also uses Boost Library (http://www.boost.org) and TinyObjLoader (http://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader/).
